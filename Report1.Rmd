## Abstract

This project investigated the relationship between gender and
observer-rated scores recorded before the subjects underwent treatment
for PTSD symptoms. It was found that males scored significantly higher
that female.

Moreover, the researchers also analysed the correlation between
pre-trial scores with their corresponding post-trial results. It was
discovered that the two variables were positively correlated and the
pre-trial OR scores could predict the post-trial ones.

---

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyse the impact of Jungian Sandplay
therapeutic technique on individuals with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). Two different scales were used to assess the patients:
observer-rated report (OR) and Child PTSD Symptoms Self-Report Version
(CPSS-SR). Both used a Likert scale from 0 to 10.

Two sets of hypotheses were tested. For the first, the goal was to
verify whether there was any significant difference in the pre-trial
observed scores between males and female. In other words, the
researchers wanted to see if gender influenced PTSD scores.

H0: there is no significant difference in pre-trial OR scores between
genders.

H1: there is a significant difference in pre-trial OR scores between
genders.

For the second set of hypotheses, the aim was to see if there was any
significant correlation between pre and post trial OR scores. The
pre-trial scores represented the explanatory variable and the post-trial
scores the response one.

H0: there is no correlation between pre and post-trial OR scores.

H1: there is a significant correlation between pre and post-trial OR
scores.

---

## Method

To start, the relationship between gender and pre-trial OR scores was
investigated. Before carrying out an Independent Samples T-Test
analysis, the data were cleaned and any missing or incorrect values were
replaced. A series of descriptive statistics were also found, as well as
some confidence intervals. Following this, normality tests were applied
and non-normal data underwent a process of logarithmic normalisation.
Once the data were normal, the t-test was implemented.

The next step consisted in addressing the second set of hypotheses. The
same series of descriptive statistics were applied, as well as normality
tests. After this, it was time to test the correlation between pre and
post-trial OR scores using Pearson's correlation.

## Results


_**1. Gender VS Pre-trial OR scores**_

Before carrying out any type of analysis, the data underwent a cleaning
process. It was noticed that the column gender presented a misspelling
error in one of the observations, and the incorrect category "Fmale" was
replaced by "Female". Furthermore, when it came to the numeric variable,
observation number 98 presented an empty cell, that was then filled with
the value of the mean.

The descriptive statistics for pre-trial OR scores were (values
pre-normalisation):

mean = 6.12;

median = 6.04;

mode = 5.83;

sd = 1.08;

IQR = 1.54;

Q1 = 5.40, Q2 = 6.04, Q3 = 6.95;

min = 3.35;

max = 8.99.

Two boxplots were also created, in order to provide visual information
about the distribution.

When considered independently, the boxplot for pre-trial OR scores
didn't show any outliers.

![](D:\DKIT\Data Analytics\Images\New\Boxplot1.png){width=40%}

However, when divided between genders the distribution for males seem to
present one outlier in the lower part.

![](D:\DKIT\Data Analytics\Images\New\Boxplot2.png){width=40%}

Another step taken in this analysis was the discovery of the confidence
intervals for the entire distribution of pre-trial scores, for the
difference in means between males and females and for the distributions
of males and females independently. Such values were 1.77 - 1.82,
-0.14 - -0.04, 1.80 - 1.88 and 1.72 - 178 respectively.

Next, the distribution was investigated for normality.

Firstly, a histogram was created. The graph did not seem to show a
normal trend.

![](D:/DKIT/Data Analytics/Images/New\Histogram3.png){width=35%}



Secondly, a Q-Q plot was implemented, and this too confirmed the
suspicion of a lack of normality.

![](D:/DKIT/Data Analytics/Images/New\qqplot4.png){width=35%}

Lastly, a Shapiro-Wilk test was performed and the results showed a p =
0.82, confirming that the distribution of pre-trial OR scores was not
normal.


Nonetheless, to perform a parametric test such as a t-test, the
distribution must be normal and this is why the next step saw the use of
a logarithmic transformation to normalise it.

It's at this point that the first set of hypotheses was finally tested
using an Independent Samples T-Test. Such test analyses whether there is
a statistically significant difference between the means of two
independent groups, in this case males and females. The results showed a
t = -3.39 with a p value below 0.001, causing the null hypothesis to be
rejected in favour of the alternative one. In other words, it could not
be proved that there was no difference between females and males in
pre-trial OR scores. Gender significantly influenced the subject's
scores with males scoring on average 6.41, and females scoring 5.83.


_**2. Pre-trial OR scores VS Post-trial**_

After establishing the presence of a significant relationship between
gender and pre-trial OR scores, it was time to compare these to their
post-trial counterparts.

Once again, the first step consisted in checking for any missing or
incorrect values. Line 126 presented a score of 12 that was replaced
with 10, the maximum value allowed by the scale.

The descriptive statistics for the pre-trial scores have been already
listed in the previous section, and here below the reader can view the
ones for the post-trial distribution.

mean = 5.43;

median = 1.8;

mode = 5.33;

sd = 1.15;

IQR = 1.51;

Q1 = 4.73, Q2 = 5.33, Q3 = 6.25;

min = 2.17;

max = 10.

In this case too, a boxplot was created. It allowed to visually
recognise the presence of two outliers in the lower part of the
distribution and one in the upper part.

![](D:/DKIT/Data Analytics/Images/Boxplot3.png){width=40%}

Moreover, while the pre-trial OR scores had been already normalised,
normality tests had to be conducted on post-trial values.

The following histogram presents a slightly right skewed distribution,
making the assumption of normality not likely.

![](D:/DKIT/Data Analytics/Images/New\Histogram5.png){width=35%}

To further investigate it, a q-q plot was also created, but once again,
the graph did not provide a unambiguous answer.

![](D:/DKIT/Data Analytics/Images/New\qqplot2.png){width=35%} 

One more step was taken and a Shapiro-Wilk analysis was performed. Such
test obtained a p = 0.047, slight below the alpha threshold of 0.05. The
decision was made to treat the distribution as normal and proceed to
apply a parametric test of correlation.

Pearson's correlation analysis was carried out. The test was found to be
significant, with p \< 0.001. This indicated the presence of a
correlation between the means of the pre and post-trial l OR scores. A
correlation coefficient of 0.53 showed a positive relationship between
the two variables. In other words, the null hypothesis had to be rejected
in favour of the alternative one.

---

## Discussion

Two types of relationships were investigated during this analysis: the
potential impact of gender on pre-trial OR scores and the possible
relationship between pre-trial and post-trial OR values.

For the first, an Independent Samples T-Test proved the significance of
the impact of gender and it was found that males, on average, scored
significantly higher than females.

Regarding the relationship between pre and post trial OR scores,
Pearson's correlation highlighted a significant positive relationship.
As the pre-trial values increased, so did the post-trial ones. In other
terms, pre-trial scores seemed to present a level of predictive power
over the post-trial ones.
